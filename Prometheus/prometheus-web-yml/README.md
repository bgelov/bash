## What kind of script is this?
The script generates a web.yml file with a password hash using [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), which is necessary to enable basic authentication for Prometheus.

## How does it work?
The script prompts for username and password.
- If there is a web.yml file, you will be prompted to either recreate it or add credentials to the end of the file.
- If there is no web.yml file, a new file will be generated.

## Example of a generated file
```
basic_auth_users:
  test:$2y$17$Ac2deeUOLKZSP2L81awluuTAiisMp46T4NTJ0MX3tpfPXC3MUVl8G
```
